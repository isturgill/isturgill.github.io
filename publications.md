### Abstract:
Aberrant expression of the _BAP1_ (_BRCA_ associated protein 1) tumor suppressor gene is a prominent risk factor for several tumor types and is important in tumor evolution and progression. Here we performed integrated multi-omics analyses using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas for 33 cancer types and over 10,000 individuals to identify alterations leading to _BAP1_ disruption. We combined existing variant calls and new calls derived from a _de novo_ local realignment pipeline across multiple independent variant callers, increasing somatic variant detection by 41% from 182 to 257, including 11 indels ≥40 bp. The expanded detection of mutations highlights the power of new tools to uncover longer indels and impactful mutations. We developed an expression-based _BAP1_ activity score and identified a transcriptional profile associated with _BAP1_ disruption in cancer. _BAP1_ has been proposed to play a critical role in controlling tumor plasticity and normal cell fate. Leveraging human and mouse liver datasets, _BAP1_ loss in normal cells resulted in lower _BAP1_ activity scores and lower scores were associated with a less-differentiated phenotype in embryonic cells. Together, our expanded _BAP1_ mutant samples revealed a transcriptional signature in cancer cells, supporting _BAP1_’s influences on cellular plasticity and cell identity maintenance.
