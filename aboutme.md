- "Big data" bioinformatics (e.g., [The Cancer Genome Atlas](https://www.cancer.gov/ccg/research/genome-sequencing/tcga))
- Cancer genomics
- Immunology
- Microbial genetics


Other professional areas of interest include:
- Data science
- Language learning (proficient with R and Python; pursuing C/C++ and TypeScript)
- Machine learning and statistics
- Software tool and pipeline development
